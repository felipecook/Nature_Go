User Story 1

Who: Kanyon the nature guru
What: Nature_Go
Where: Kanyon uses my application on his weekends when he is out in the wilderness and is looking for additional information on animals that could be in his area. 
Why: Kanyon was looking through his google play store and was unable to find an application that would be easy to use and would also not be taxing on his battery life or os. 
How: Kanyon while on his walk, opens the application and signs into his user account which saves simple user preferences. After signing in, Kanyon chooses if he wants to see birds, mammals or fish that are in his nearby area. After selecting that, he can select specifically the fish, bird or mammal he wants to see more information on. Once on the specific page he will be able to view information including the habitat and latin name of the animal, he will also be able to view a picture of the animal.
